# JavaFox-Web-Browser
A simple web browser made in JavaFX. The icons I use are from www.flaticon.com.

Features:
- Navigable multitab view
- PDF viewer (PDF.js)
- Downloading files support

Alert dialogs added when:
- You try to exit the application while there are downloads still in progress

Improvements:

- Now you can see a list of your downloads and its state by clicking on the 'Downloads' button in the ToolBar.
